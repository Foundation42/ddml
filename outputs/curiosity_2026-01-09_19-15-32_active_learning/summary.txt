CURIOSITY EXPERIMENT RESULTS
============================
Timestamp: 2026-01-09_19-15-32

CONFIGURATION:
  Pool size: 10000
  Bootstrap samples: 50
  Samples per round: 50
  Total rounds: 10
  Total samples used: 550

FINAL ACCURACY:
  Random Brain:  83.5%
  Curious Brain: 88.0%

SAMPLE EFFICIENCY:
  Samples to reach 80%:
    Random:  300
    Curious: 250
    Efficiency: 1.2x

  Samples to reach 90%:
    Random:  550
    Curious: 550
    Efficiency: 1.0x

KEY FINDING:
  The Curious Brain, by actively seeking confusing examples,
  OUTPERFORMED
  random sampling with 1.2x better sample efficiency.

  This validates the hypothesis: Knowing what you don't know
  is a computational advantage, not just a philosophical nicety.
