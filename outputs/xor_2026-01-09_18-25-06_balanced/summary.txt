DIALOGUE-DRIVEN MACHINE LEARNING - XOR EXPERIMENT
==================================================
Timestamp: 2026-01-09_18-25-06
Personality: balanced

CONFIGURATION:
  Phase 1 (XOR): 200 steps
  Phase 2 (XNOR): 200 steps
  Phase 3 (XOR return): 100 steps
  Batch size: 32
  Seed: 42

RESULTS:
  Phase 1 (XOR) Final Accuracy:
    Dialogue System: 92.2%
    Single Baseline: 100.0%

  Phase 2 (XNOR) Final Accuracy:
    Dialogue System: 90.0%
    Single Baseline: 78.8%

  Recovery Time (steps to 80% after switch):
    Dialogue System: 56 steps
    Single Baseline: 122 steps
    Speedup: 2.2x

  Learning Efficiency:
    Dialogue updates: 230/500 steps (46.0%)
    Compute saved: 54.0%

KEY FINDINGS:
  - Dialogue system recovered 66 steps faster
  - Selective learning saved 54% of compute
  - Post-switch accuracy: Dialogue 90% vs Baseline 79%
